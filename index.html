<div class="intro">


    <p>On September 1, 2021, hurricane Ida hit New York City, causing unprecedented floods. At least 21 people were killed. Flooding affects more people than any other environmental hazard in the world, causing house displacement, economic losses, and a rise in exposure to disease. In 57 countries,the increase in flood exposure is expected to outpace future population growth, especially in Asia and Africa. </p> 

    <p>As global warming is increasing the risk of floods happening across the world, countries need to address the issue by creating more effective preventive and emergency response plans, and by addressing climate change altogether.</p>

            <p>From 2000 to 2015 the population affected by floods grew from 58 million to 86 million. Satellite monitoring projections forecast that the population exposed to floods will increase further for 2030.</p>

    <p>In the U.S., approximately 45,523 people are yearly displaced from their homes by floods. From 2008 to 2018, floods caused over half of climate and weather-related displacements in the world. </p>

    <p>Flooding is one of the main weather-related disasters that cause numerous fatalities every year across the world. In the U.S., approximately 100 people are killed annually by floods.</p>
    <p>Driving or walking into floodwaters accounts for more than 86% of total flood fatalities.</p>
